# Anything you don't want people to see on GitHub that isn't a password or encrypted

# All of these secrets may (and probably will be) put into the world-readable nix-store
# on the build and target hosts. You'll most likely want to store personally identifiable
# information here, such as:
#   - MAC Addreses
#   - Static IP addresses
#   - Your full name (when configuring e.g. users)
#   - Your postal address (when configuring e.g. home-assistant)
